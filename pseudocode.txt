I need to rewrite my calculator code to function how they actually specified it to work.

I might do this another day and continue to make my current version work. 

But if I were to do this I need the following:

An empty array to store calculations

Number Button function to still print the numbers into the display

Operator button function to not print to display but when pressed it will store the display value in array, along with the operator button value (splicing?) [FIRST] if the array is =>3 then run my loop to execute calculation and update display then remove first three array items and replace it with the current answer.

Repeat above steps

Equal button will run the same function to find current calculation.
